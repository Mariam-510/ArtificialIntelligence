# Checkers Project
1. Implement an AI agent for a board game (Checkers).
2. it is computer vs agent (computer random move and agent minimax or alpha-beta).
3. Implement Minimax algorithm.
4. Refine the AI agent using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm.
5. Implement a GUI to select the algorithm type and difficulty level of the game.
